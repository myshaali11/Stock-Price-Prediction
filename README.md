# Stock-Price-Prediction

## Description
This project predicts stock prices using linear regression. It utilizes the S&P 500 dataset to analyze and forecast closing prices for a given stock.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Linear regression for price prediction.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for Data Manipulation and Analysis
- Numpy for Numerical Computation
- Matplotlib for Data Plotting into line graphs
- Scikit-learn for ML tools

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python is installed.
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Progress

The project uses ML concepts of a basic linear regression model that uses a dataset imported from Kaggle and worked on static(compile time) basis first. After the verification and correctness of the graph and working, I decided to make the app dynamic. The next step is to integrate it into a web application and modularize the code
